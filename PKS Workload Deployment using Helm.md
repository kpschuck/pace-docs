# PKS Workload Deployment using Helm

In this lab/demo, we will show you how to deploy a set of applications using Helm on a K8s cluster. This exercise serves multiple purposes - 

1. How to interact with Helm to deploy applications
2. Since the choice of application is Prometheus and Grafana, it will also show how to start with monitoring and reporting on a K8s cluster
3. Show how to interact with an application running on K8s cluster. 

### Requirements 

- A working K8s cluster with admin access.
