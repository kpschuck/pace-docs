# PKS Logging using syslog

PKS logging can be enabled and configured at 3 different levels - 

1. Individual K8s namespaces within a cluster
2. Individual K8s clusters
3. PKS Control plane
4. BOSH Director and its components

For this lab, we will use Papertrail. Users can bring their own logging systems that follow the syslog protocol.
